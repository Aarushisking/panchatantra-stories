    <p class="text3"> A golden goat lived in a thick forest. She was almost as big as a pony. She was also very strong. Her coat shone in the sunlight just like fire. She had sharp, pointed horns and all the animals in the forest were scared of her. Even the lion and the tiger were afraid to come near her.The golden goat was a happy animal. She ate the best and the greenest grass, and everyone kept from her. One day, as she was eating grass, she saw a farmer's field at a distance. She saw ripe and juicy turnips!  The goat jumped into the middle of the field. She chewed one delicious turnip after the other. The farmer saw her, picked up his stoutest stick and beat the goat! From a far, the lion saw the farmer beating the goat. The lion thought "If the farmer can beat her, then, i can surely eat her. Why should i be scared?" The lion waited till the goat came back to the forest. She was tierd and was walking slowly. The lion pounced on her and killed her.
