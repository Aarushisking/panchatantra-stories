    <p class="text-4"> Once, there lived a boy who loved all kinds of sport. One day he went swimming so far out into the river that he began struggling against the strong current. As the boy began to sink, he caught sight of a man standing near shore. He yelled to him for help. But insted of coming to save the boy's rescue the man stood there and began advising the boy to be more carefull in the future. The boy, who was close to drowning, said "Sir, save you sermon for later. Please do something to save me, first!" Advice without practical help is no use to anyone. </p>
