        Once, when a cunning wolf was eating his dinner, a bone got stuck in his throat. He could not take it out and howled in pain. He could not sleep at night, and in the morning, he could not eat anything. The wolf was worried. He thought that if the bone would remain stuck, he would not be able to eat anything and would surely die of hunger. Suddenly, he remembered a crane that lived nearby. He went to the crane, and said , My freind, i have a bone stuck deep in my throat. Please pull it out and i will always be greatful to you. I will pay you for your help. The crane happly agreed to help. The wolf opened his mouth wide and the crane inserted hes beak into his throat
