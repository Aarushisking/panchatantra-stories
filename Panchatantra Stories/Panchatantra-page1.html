    <p class="text-1">Once upon a time there lived two gamblers. One of them was good at heart,while the other was dishonest. Whenever the latter sensed that he was losing a gamble, he used to furtivuely swollow the dice and exclaim that it had got lost. Once, not√≠cing the trick, the other gambler vowed to teach him a lesson. Next day, he smeared the dice with poison before the game started. When the dishonest man began to lose, he sneaked the dice into his mouth as usual.The posion took effect and he fell sick. But the other gambler, a kind person. nursed him back to health" My friend, i did this just to teach you a lesson. Never ever deceive a friend," he said. </p>
